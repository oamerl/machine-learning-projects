## Project Description

In this project we used PySpark to tackle an unsupervised machine learning problem which is clustering. We analyzed customer purchasing data to segment and cluster customers based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics.
In searching for customer data to use in this project we checked various sources but we found the datasets provided on Kaggle to be our best option as this will save a lot of time that can be put in modeling rather than spending time in trying to scrape the data from customer surveys or social media websites and then spend more time in trying to understand the obtained data so we settled on Kaggle.
We considered two different datasets with the same structure of features but differing in the timeframe and we aggregated them in CSV format. The datasets used contains transactional data which contains all transactions for a UK-based non-store online retail shop which sells all-occasion gifts.
Data collected is for the period between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.
