## Project Description

* During this project we assessed different classifiers performances on a dataset of symptoms indicating whether a person is going to recover from coronavirus or not. These pre-defined standard symptoms were based on guidelines given by the World Health Organization (WHO).
* The dataset used has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. The dataset contained 14 major variables that will be having an impact on whether someone has recovered or not. The data was already cleaned and preprocessed.
* We designed different classifiers such as KNN, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees and SVM to the predict the outcome death/recovery for new patients when admitted to a hospital. For each classifier, we found the optimal hyperparameters and assessed the model performance on training and testing data.
