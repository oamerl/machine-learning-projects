## Project Description
*   **Problem Formulation:** the goal of this task is to predict whether two people are good match for each other or not based on their profiles (tinder-like) such that we can implement a recommendation system that recommends potentialy better mates for the user based on his profile. The problem here is binary classification in which we output the probability that these 2 people will be successfuly matched together based on a model trained on the provided dating session dataset.
*   **The impact** that this task will have is that if we could build a model with good performance on classifying the outcome of a dating session we could use this data later to build a recommendation system which in turn if became successful and recommended the right matches to people we can start to monetize the service and offer paid subscriptions, say for example offering higher number of recommendations per week and people will be willing to pay if they trusted the service and the provided value through the recommender system was good enough and reliable, so it will open a new revenue stream. Also we will be able understand the customer base of the service and many demographics about the users of such service.
*   **The ideal solution** as will be discussed below was found to be XGboosting model.
