*   Problem Formulation: the goal of this task is to predict product rating when a new product is to be put on wish.com aiming to understand what certain conditions might make a producted to be highly rated which will be translated to higher purchasing rates and eventually more revenue. In doing so we will also understand wish.com customer base and what are their prefrences. We will try to solve this probelm using a tabular dataset containg a history of purchased products and their ratings alongside their other related features.
*   We will treat this problem as a classification problem where we will be having 5 categories of ratings from 1 start up to 5 stars where we will be using the provided dataset into building this classification model.
*   We aim at the end of building this model we will be able to predict whether a product will be having a high rating or not before being listed on the website such that we can make any adjustments to the product to make it more favorable to the people and increase its purchase probability to increase the business revenues.
*   The ideal solution as will be discussed below was found to be XGboosting model.
