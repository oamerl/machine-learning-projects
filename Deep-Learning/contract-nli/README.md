## Project Description

In this project we explore using pre-trained models on NLP tasks. Specifically, we study a data set named ContractNLI. ContractNLI is a dataset for document-level natural language inference (NLI) on contracts whose goal is to automate/support a time-consuming procedure of contract review.

In this task, a system is given a set of hypotheses and a contract, and it is asked to classify whether each hypothesis is entailed by, contradicting to or not mentioned by (neutral to) the contract as well as identifying evidence for the decision as spans in the contract. The complete description of this dataset could be found here: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/contract-nli/.

Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether the given “hypothesis” logically follows from the “premise”. This is a popular NLP task which also considered as a pre-training task in BERT. More SOTA approaches on this task can be found here: https://paperswithcode.com/task/naturallanguage-inference.

Our goal is to perform natural language inference on the mentioned dataset.
