## Project Description

*   **Problem Formulation:** the goal of this project is to predict the "price" and "type" of an apartment based on an image of it and a describtion so this can be treated as multi-task multi-modal problem.
*   **The impact** that this task will have is that if we could build a model with good performance on classifying the price category we'll be able to optimize user experience and lower the bar to be a new host by listng an adequate price and increase the revenues, as one of the biggest problems when people prepare to post a new listing on airbnb is, how much should one ask for, so one either lists a high price and losses potential customers or lists lower price and lose revenue so this model will optimize the price listing for both the businsess owner and the customer.
*   **The ideal solution** as will be discussed below was found to be simple CNN with text embeddings which is model 1.
