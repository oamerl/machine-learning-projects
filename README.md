# machine-learning-projects

The repository houses a collection of my machine learning and deep learning projects that I've worked on, showcasing a diverse range of applications and techniques. The repo is organized into three main folders: `Machine-Learning`, `Deep-Learning` and `Reinforcement-Learning`. Each folder contains individual projects, each project is organized into its own folder for clarity and ease of navigation. Each project is encapsulated within its own Jupyter Notebook, providing a detailed walkthrough, analysis, and insights.


## Folder Structure:
- **Machine-Learning:**
  - Contains traditional machine learning projects showcasing diverse algorithms.
  - Each project is organized into its own folder for clarity.

- **Deep-Learning:**
  - Projects leveraging deep learning techniques and frameworks.
  - Projects in this folder showcase applications of neural networks and deep learning architectures.

- **Reinforcement-Learning:**
  - Dedicated to projects involving reinforcement learning methodologies.
  - Explore implementations of algorithms for sequential decision-making tasks.

- Notebooks are documented to provide insights into the problem, methodology, and results.


## Explore the Notebooks:
1. Navigate to the `Machine-Learning`, `Deep-Learning` or `Reinforcement-Learning` folder based on your interest.
2. Access individual projects by navigating to their respective directories.
3. Review the Jupyter Notebooks to gain insights into the implementation details and methodologies employed.
